            "I designed and built a voice-controlled robotic car using a 3D-printed chassis, Arduino motors, 
            an L298 motor driver, and a Raspberry Pi Zero W. To enable voice control, I integrated VOSK, a 
            speech recognition model, to process voice input into a string, which was then transmitted to 
            the Raspberry Pi via a Netcat pipeline. A Bash script then captured the incoming command, while a 
            Python script interfaced with the L298 motor driver to enable real-time control of the car's movement."

            attention spans by making learning more engaging and interactive."
